# Health Reform Modeling as a Discrete Time Markov Process

This section outlines a simple discrete time markov model for health insurance coverage in the U.S. population. We begin by defining an ex ante occupancy vector $\mathbf{p_{exa}}$ that summarizes the fraction of the population in each major health insurance type (employer-sponsored insurance, other private insurance, public insurance, and uninsured) in the pre-reform period.

\[
\mathbf{p_{exa}}=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
p_{exa,esi}\\
p_{exa,pri}\\
p_{exa,pub}\\
p_{exa,unin}
\end{array}
\right) 
\]
where $p_{exa,k}$ is the fraction of the population in each insurance category $k$ in the ex ante period.

Now define the transition probability matrix:

\[
\mathbf{R} =  [r_{k,j}] =   
\begin{pmatrix}
      r_{esi,esi} & r_{esi,pri} & r_{esi,pub} & r_{esi,unin}  \\
       r_{pri,esi} & r_{pri,pri} & r_{pri,pub} & r_{pri,unin}  \\
        r_{pub,esi} & r_{pub,pri} & r_{pub,pub} & r_{pub,unin}  \\
         r_{unin,esi} & r_{unin,pri} & r_{unin,pub} & r_{unin,unin}  
    \end{pmatrix}
\]
where $r_{k,j}$ is the probability of transitioning from ex ante category $k$ to ex post category $j$.

Finally, we can define an ex post occupancy vector:

\[
\mathbf{p_{exp}}=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
p_{exp,esi}\\
p_{exp,pri}\\
p_{exp,pub}\\
p_{exp,unin}
\end{array}
\right) 
\]

Basic matrix algebra links the two occupancy vectors as follows: 

\[
\begin{aligned}
    \begin{pmatrix}
p_{exa,esi}\\
p_{exa,pri}\\
p_{exa,pub}\\
p_{exa,unin} \\
    \end{pmatrix}'
        \cdot
    \begin{pmatrix}
      r_{esi,esi} & r_{esi,pri} & r_{esi,pub} & r_{esi,unin}  \\
       r_{pri,esi} & r_{pri,pri} & r_{pri,pub} & r_{pri,unin}  \\
        r_{pub,esi} & r_{pub,pri} & r_{pub,pub} & r_{pub,unin}  \\
         r_{unin,esi} & r_{unin,pri} & r_{unin,pub} & r_{unin,unin} 
    \end{pmatrix}
    &=&
    \begin{pmatrix}
p_{exp,esi}\\
p_{exp,pri}\\
p_{exp,pub}\\
p_{exp,unin} \\
    \end{pmatrix}'
  \end{aligned}
\]

In the equation above, the set of transition probabilities $r_{k,j}$ can be considered sufficient statistics for evaluating the impact of a policy change on health insurance coverage in the population. That is, once we know these probabilities and how they change under a given reform option, we can simulate the impact on the overall coverage distribution in the population. By attaching costs to population movements among insurance types, we can simulate the cost impact to the government. And finally, as we show below, social welfare weights can also be attached to population movements. These weights can then be aggregated and compared across reform alternatives to make comparative evaluations of policy options.
