# Introduction 

The objective of this document is to sketch out some initial thoughts and analytics around a unified framework for ex ante policy evaluation in health care. 

## Background and Motivation

Models projecting the impact of health reforms on health insurance programs and markets play an important role in shaping the contours of U.S. health policy.  In 2017, for example, Congressional attempts Congressional attempts to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA). These efforts collapsed, in part, under public outcry after the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) [projected](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/us/politics/cbo-congressional-budget-office-health-care.html) that upwards of 23 million people would become uninsured. The twists and turns of earlier debates over the ACA--and before it, [the Clinton health plan](figures/01_nyt-clinton-cbo.png)--also were shaped by modelers' assessments of how reform would impact insurance coverage, premiums, health care spending, and government costs. 

Microsimulation models used by the CBO and by others to produce these estimates draw on a large and growing literature on economic theory, and on evaluations of past state and federal reform efforts. Yet while modelers often draw on the same evidence base as inputs into their models, microsimulation models differ greatly in their structure, underlying data sources and assumptions. Consequently, models often produce widely varying projections of the same policy alternative. As such, microsimulation models have been subject to criticisms over their "black box"-like qualities, and over their tendency to produce estimates with unin to no accompanying sense of uncertainty or sensitivity to alternative parameter values and assumptions.

# Health Reform Modeling as a Discrete Time Markov Process

In this section, I will outline a simple discrete time markov model to summarize changes in health insurance in the U.S. population. We begin by defining an ex ante occupancy vector $\mathbf{p_{exa}}$, which summarizes the fraction of the population in each major health insurance type (employer-sponsored insurance, other private insurance, public insurance, and uninsured) ($p_{exa,esi} = Pr(I_{exa,k} = \texttt{esi})$)

\[
\mathbf{p_{exa}}=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
p_{exa,esi}\\
p_{exa,pri}\\
p_{exa,pub}\\
p_{exa,unin}
\end{array}
\right) 
\]
where $p_{exa,k}$ is the fraction of the population in each insurance category $k$ in the ex ante period.

Now define the transition probability matrix:

\[
\mathbf{R} =  [r_{k,j}] =   
\begin{pmatrix}
      r_{esi,esi} & r_{esi,pri} & r_{esi,pub} & r_{esi,unin}  \\
       r_{pri,esi} & r_{pri,pri} & r_{pri,pub} & r_{pri,unin}  \\
        r_{pub,esi} & r_{pub,pri} & r_{pub,pub} & r_{pub,unin}  \\
         r_{unin,esi} & r_{unin,pri} & r_{unin,pub} & r_{unin,unin}  
    \end{pmatrix}
\]
where $r_{k,j}$ is the probability of transitioning from ex ante category $k$ to ex post category $j$.

Finally, we can define an ex post occupancy vector as follows:

\[
\mathbf{p_{exp}}=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
p_{exp,esi}\\
p_{exp,pri}\\
p_{exp,pub}\\
p_{exp,unin}
\end{array}
\right) 
\]

Basic matrix algebra links the two occupancy vectors as follows: 

\[
\begin{aligned}
    \begin{pmatrix}
p_{exa,esi}\\
p_{exa,pri}\\
p_{exa,pub}\\
p_{exa,unin} \\
    \end{pmatrix}'
        \cdot
    \begin{pmatrix}
      r_{esi,esi} & r_{esi,pri} & r_{esi,pub} & r_{esi,unin}  \\
       r_{pri,esi} & r_{pri,pri} & r_{pri,pub} & r_{pri,unin}  \\
        r_{pub,esi} & r_{pub,pri} & r_{pub,pub} & r_{pub,unin}  \\
         r_{unin,esi} & r_{unin,pri} & r_{unin,pub} & r_{unin,unin} 
    \end{pmatrix}
    &=&
    \begin{pmatrix}
p_{exp,esi}\\
p_{exp,pri}\\
p_{exp,pub}\\
p_{exp,unin} \\
    \end{pmatrix}^T
  \end{aligned}
\]

In the equation above, the set of transition probabilities $r_{k,j}$ can be considered sufficient statistics for evaluating the impact of a policy change on health insurance coverage in the population.
